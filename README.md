Implementing some data structures and algorithms from FreeCodeCamp tutorial 
with TreeHouse using Python.

Finished the course! Learned some basic sorting algos such as quick sort,
selection sort (not great), as well as searches such as binary search and
linear search. Finally, I also learned some intro to DS such as arrays
and linked list.
